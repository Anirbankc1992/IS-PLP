Employee #1 was working  alone  removing safety brackets  with an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene)  from  the column supporting the trellis. The trellis brackets were about 18 ft above  the ground. Employee #1 noticed that the steel tube connecting the trellis to  the northwest column was not straight. Employee #1 was the foreman responsible  for safety and the proper installation of the trellis at the site. Employee #1  decided that the welded connection at the northwest column was unacceptable  and had to be repaired. Employee #1 used an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene) to  cut the bottom weld on the steel tube connecting the trellis to the northwest  column. When the bottom weld was cut  the weight of the trellis was too great  for the remaining welds to support the 15 000 pound structural steel trellis.  This action allowed the northwest corner of the trellis to fall approximately  two ft and trap Employee #1 between the trellis and the wall. Apparently  the  structural design of the structure was modified by an unqualified foreman   when he removed structural welds. This caused the remaining welds to fail  under the load  and allow the structure to fall. Employee #1 was transported  to the hospital  and he was admitted for over 24 hours  for chest and facial  fractures.                                                                      '],\n",

This would cause a runaway reaction and  ultimately result in an explosion. A small leak had developed in the lower  bushing of the agitator and the employer instructed an employee to tighten it  with a wrench. The employer replaced the normal feed (a mixture of styrene  monomer  ground rubber  and acrylonitrile) with pure styrene monomer  which  has a much lower viscosity  to \"\"flush\"\" the process in the hope that this would  stop the leak. The mixture began to spill through the lower agitator packing  and at approximately 2:30 p.m.  there occurred a major spill of styrene  monomer (flammable) and acrylonitrile (flammable and carcinogenic). Dow  evacuated the plant and called for outside assistance to stop the spill and  initiate clean-up. The clean-up was completed on June 12  1999. This was the  third near-miss that Dow experienced on this unit between August  1998 and  June 11  1999. No information on employee injuries was provided.                \"'],\n",

They had been hired by  the homeowner to cut down an 80-foot (24-meter) pine tree with a base diameter  of 36 inches (0.9 meters) that had been struck by lightning. The top section  of pine tree had been felled by the lightning. It was split down the middle.  The length of the felled section was 492 inches (12.5 meters)  with a split  down the middle 457 inches (11.6 meters) long. The width of the split ranged  between 1 and 3 feet (0.3 and 0.9 meters). During the tree cutting operation   Employee #1 was working from the bucket of an aerial lift and using a chain  saw. The chain saw was a Husqvarna  with Serial Number 2013 0500130. It was  equipped with a Husqvarna RSN chain saw blade and a Husqvarna 3/8 84 DL 92570  bar. The bar was 24 inches (610 millimeters) long. It held a chain 84 links  long. The links had an 0.375-inch (9.5-millimeter) pitch. The aerial lift and  boom had no manufacturer's labeling or scribing  and there was no owner's  manual identifying which manufacturer had made it. The aerial lift and boom  manufacturer's name  model numbers  serial numbers were unknown. The bucket  was constructed of glass fiber or fiberglass and attached to the boom with a  mounting bracket and bolts. It was 24 inches (0.61 meters) long by 24 inches  (0.61 meters) wide by 40 inches (1.0 meters) high. The bucket was equipped  with a liner and upper controls. The liner was made from a Teflon plastic. It  was 23.75 inches (0.60 meters) long by 23.75 inches (0.60 meters) wide by 40  inches (1.0 meters) high. The upper controls consisted of a pistol grip and  joystick. The pistol grip activated the joystick. The joystick controlled the  boom by rotating  raising  lowering  extending  and retracting it. Prior to  felling the tree  Employee #1 assessed the tree for stability. The  three-person team employed a work line and conventional notch cut as a method  to cut down the tree. Employee #1 used a conventional notch method to notch  the tree approximately 35 to 45 feet (10.7 to 13.7 meters) from the ground.  The conventional notching required a face cut. Employee #1 made the proper  face cut with a 45-degree top cut and a horizontal bottom cut. The top cut was  a 45-degree downward angle cut  the bottom cut was flat and horizontal  and  the back cut was horizontal  at least 1 inch (25 millimeters) above the bottom  cut. The back cut  however  was approximately 12 to 18 inches (300 to 450  millimeters) above the bottom cut. Employee #1's cut exceeded that of the  horizontal face by approximately 12 to 18 inches (300 to 450 millimeters).  Employee #1 tied a 200-foot (61-meter) work line to the tree trunk  approximately 65 feet (19.8 meters) from the ground. The two coworkers pulled  on the work line to guide the top section of the tree down. When Employee #1  cut 9 inches (230 millimeters) into the tree  the tree fell back and on top of  the aerial lift  shearing the bucket off the boom. Employee #1 and the aerial  lift fell more than 35 feet (10.7 meters) to the ground. One of the coworkers  called emergency response and administered medical aid.

The engineering staff were a plumber  engineer (an employee at the Orleans for less than a month)  a skilled  laborer  a locksmith engineer  a general engineer  and three supervisors (the  chief engineer  an assistant engineer and the swing shift assistant engineer).  Employees #1  #2  #3 and their four coworkers were assessing the situation and  had removed five manhole covers from the grease trap and sewer system. A plug  in the pipe emptying into the pit under the last manhole by the loading dock  was causing wastewater to back up into the grease interceptor pit.

The person notified the employer that the crash cushion could not  be powered up to its upright storage position  and that he had to use a  forklift to lift the crash cushion upright. The crash cushion was secured in  the upright position with safety straps. In order for the truck to be used at  another site  Employee #1 and Employee #2 tried to solve the problem. They  undid the safety straps and tried to use the controls to power down the crash  cushion. Employee #2 was in the front of the truck  and Employee #1 went into  the shop to get a slider board and jumper wire. When he returned to the truck   he slid under the crash cushion. Due to the location of the jumper wire and  the troubleshooting description in the crash cushion manual  it was surmised  that Employee #1 most likely attached one end of the jumper wire to the copper  bus bar and the other end to the electrical solenoid. It is also believed that  this troubleshooting procedure could have caused hydraulic pressure to be  released. Because nothing was in place to hold the crash cushion in its  upright position  the crash cushion fell onto Employee #1  crushing his head  against the pavement and the rear of the truck  killing him due to blunt force  trauma of the head.

       "  ' On October 6  2009  Employee #1 and two coworkers were setting up extrusion  line Number 2 to extrude PVC (polyvinyl chloride) material into a  21-inch-diameter irrigation pipe. The crew on the night shift had worked on  the equipment  preparing it for the set up phase. The line equipment consisted  of an extruder  a metal die  a sizing sleeve  a cooling spray tank  and a pipe  saw. Employee #1 was an assistant line foreman  who assisted in getting the  line running. The first coworker was a line foreman who was in charge of  turning the machine on and making adjustments as the PVC pipe was extruded. A  second coworker acted as a helper in getting the line running. Before  production began  the PVC pipe had to be extruded to about forty-five feet. As  the first section of PVC was extruded  it was attached to an old section of  pipe  so that it could be pulled out to about forty-five feet. To ensure that  the extruded pipe kept its shape and did not get out of round  air was  injected into the pipe as it was extruded. At the beginning of the process  a  plug was installed at the end of the PVC pipe  so that the air would stay  inside the pipe. This plug was connected to the front end die by a  42-foot-long log chain. The plug moved with the pipe as it lengthened during  set up. It had been inside the far end of the pipe for about 6 hours as the  pipe was being prepared for production. It was held in place by its force  against the side walls of the pipe and also by a chain connecting the plug to  the extruder die at the other end. During the set up phase  prior to  production  the foreman and crew constantly adjusted the air pressure inside  the pipe. Air was injected into the pipe cavity  and the pressure was  regulated manually by the workers  who would turn a regulator screw up or  down. At the time of the accident  about 42 feet of chain connected the plug  to the die. An air pressure gauge was in place near the manual control and the  air pressure regulator. Near the end of the set up phase  air pressure built  up inside the pipe. This resultant force pushed on the plug  causing failure  of the quick link chain connector. When the quick link failed  the plug was  ejected from the end of the pipe. It struck Employee #1  who was standing at  the end of the pipe  in the chest. He died at the scene. There were no other  injuries.                                                                       '],\n",

Employee #1 was hired as the  company's Chief Engineer  and was in charge of the facility. Employee #1 was  working with another employee installing the new Milltonics RW15 Machining  Center that had arrived that morning. The machining center had been placed in  the facility where it was going to be mounted  but was still mounted to the  shipping pallet. Employee #1 made plans to lift the 6 500 lb. machining center  by jacking up the back of the machine using an air bladder type of lifting  device  a double convolute type air spring  Model Number YI-2B12  Assembly  Number 419  rated to lift/support up to 8 200 lbs. He was then going to lift  the front of the machining center with the company's forklift and pull the  shipping pallet out. The air spring is used by the company as a component in a  valve they manufacture  and is not designed or intended to be used as a fully  supported jack. Employee #1  had experience utilizing lifting bladders as the  assistant Fire Chief of a local volunteer fire department  and wanted to use  them for this lift. Installation of the previous machining centers in the  facility was contracted out. However  due to the smaller size of this  machining center  Employee #1 told the company president they could position  the machine and get it mounted to the floor themselves. The machining center  mount base is 26.5 inches wide and the main body of the machining center is 73  inches wide  and overhangs the base on each end. The mounting base is  positioned at the center of gravity on the machining center  creating a 23.75  inch overhand on the left side of the machining center. Employee #1 was  positioned under the left side overhang on his hands and knees and placed the  air bladder lifting device under the machining center inside the mounting  base. The air bladder was connected to the shop air and controlled through a  quarter-turn shut off valve in the air line. Employee #1 inflated the air  spring until it contacted the milling machine and stopped. A second employee  was positioned at the right end of the machining center. Employee #1 stated he  wanted to see if the spring would lift the machining center and was going to  inflate it a small amount before positioning the forklift. Employee #1 opened  the valve and the machining center rose up suddenly and started to slowly roll  to the left. The second employee grabbed the machine on the right side and  tried to hold it down to prevent if from rolling over and yelled for Employee  #1 to get out of the way. The machining center continued to roll causing the  overhanging edge to strike Employee #1 in the back  pinning him to the floor  in a fetal position face down. The machining center continued to roll until  the upper edge of the machine struck an adjacent machining center and stopped.  The second employee ran around the machine and noted that Employee #1 was  pinned and yelled for a third employee who was operating a CNC lathe  approximately 12 feet away. Other employees from the adjacent room also heard  the yelling and responded to the scene. In an effort to roll the machine off  of Employee #1  they hooked up the forklift with a cargo strap to the top of  the machining center and attempted to pull the machine back into an upright  position. The machine kept trying to roll back and they realized the air to  the air spring was in the full open position  allowing the air spring to  continue to push the machining center over. The second employee ran around to  the back of the machine and disconnected the air spring from the shop air at  the wall. They were then able to roll the machine back onto the pallet. At  this time medical emergency responders arrived on scene and pronounced  Employee #1 dead at the scene.                                                  \"],\n",

As part of the  preparation work  an old asphalt-covered taxiway was being demolished. The  area had been marked by \"\"Dig Alert\"\" to indicate buried electrical lines. There  were electrical vaults in front of the tractor about twenty yards away  to the  right of the tractor about 3 yards away  and behind the tractor about fifty  yards away. The asphalt had been marked in red where the wires entered and  exited the vaults  and on the asphalt in front of the tractor. There was no  marking  however  on the side of the vault to the operator\\'s right to indicate  any lines entering it. The job being performed at the time of the accident was  \"\"potholing\"\" for soil samples to test for chemical contamination. Because the  lines entering the nearby vault had not been marked  the operator assumed  there were no cables where he was digging. As he dug  he contacted conductors  energized at 34.5 kilovolts approximately twelve inches below the surface. He  had been well trained  and as a result he stayed in the cab of his tractor  until emergency crews deenergized the conductors. This took approximately 3  hours.

He was using a Bosch 4000 stand-mounted  benchtop table saw with a 10-inch blade to cut wood pieces for framing  modifications. As he was making the first rip cut to a section of laminated  wood product measuring approximately 16 inches long by 1.75 inches wide by 4  inches high  his left hand contacted the blade. His left hand and fingers were  severely cut. Emergency services were called  and the Mountain View Fire  Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to Stanford Hospital  where  he was admitted and treated. His left middle finger  which had been completely  severed past the first knuckle near the palm  was surgically reattached. The  left ring finger  which was severed through the bone past the first knuckle   also was reattached  but during a return hospital visit this finger required  surgical amputation. This event was timely reported to Cal/OSHA by the  employer  and also reported by the Mountain View Fire Department. In its  subsequent investigation  Cal/OSHA identified the employer as a construction  management company performing as a general contractor for this residential  apartment building project  with tasks being performed by its own employees as  well as subcontractors. The task Employee #1 was performing required two rip  cuts to the section of laminated wood product to achieve the desired finished  piece  because the blade was capable of rising only to approximately 3 inches  high. Employee #1 was working alone  and no witness to the event was  identified. The guard for the Bosch 4000 included a hood  a splitter  and an  anti-kickback device combined as a single unit. This guard/hood was at the  site  but Employee #1 stated the guard was not installed on the saw at the  time he began to plan and perform his cuts. Employee #1 stated he set the rip  fence to the right of the blade at approximately 1.25 inches and had no other  anti-kickback attachments  separate from the guard/hood  available to install.  He also stated he did not install any featherboards or jigs to use as he made  cuts without the use of the guard/hood. Employee #1 stated he was pushing and  guiding the wood through the blade  with his right hand positioned at the end  of the wood length nearest to him  and his left hand positioned on the top and  at the end of the wood farther away from him. He stated there was no push  block or push stick at the saw  and he did not make one to use. He stated that  the first cut was almost complete  and the blade was about to come out at the  back side of the wood piece  when the wood kicked back and shot past his right  side. He stated his left hand was extended behind and over the saw blade  before the cut  but was pulled back partially by the kick-back  or his hand  movement may have been reflexive. The result was that his left hand contacted  the blade. The investigation report included a comment that the guard   anti-kickback  and spreader features of the Bosch 4000 were not separable.  They were designed to extend above and past the blade of the saw and would not  have allowed the uncut portion of the wood piece to have passed. The first cut  of the employee's two-step cutting plan was similar to a dado or cut where the  blade does not extend through the top of the wood. The report concluded that  the type of rip cut Employee #1 was making was allowable without use of the  blade's guard/hood only when additional protective devices  such as  featherboards  were being used and separate anti-kickback devices had been  installed. No protective devices  such as featherboards or anti-kickback  attachments  were available or installed on the table saw during the time when  the saw's guard/hood was not in place. No push sticks or push blocks were  available during the time when the table saw was being used.  \"],\n",

Employee #1 then positioned himself in front of the  machine to install a new blade (Number: ten). The coworker then opened the  panel and began to trouble shoot the test station. The test station turned on  and activated the cutting machine. Employee #1 was unscrewing a screw under  the inside bottom of the outer bowl of the machine  as it was activated.

Two of Employee #1's fingers were pinched and then amputated   at the distal phalanx of the thumb and at the middle phalanx of the left index  finger. Employee #1 was hospitalized. The investigation concluded that the  accident was caused as a result of failure to take positive means  such as  disconnecting the machine from its source of power  or other action which  would have effectively prevented the machine from inadvertent movement.         \"],\n",

Along with a third worker  the elevator operator  they were  riding inside a freight elevator delivering sixty cases of hangers to a  customer on the tenth floor of an eleven-story office building in Los Angeles   CA. The freight elevator was installed before 1947 and was used exclusively  for carrying freight. Only the operator and persons necessary for unloading  and loading freight were permitted to ride. The elevator was maintained and  operated under a valid elevator permit issued by the City of Los Angeles  Department of Building and Safety. It could accommodate 15 people. The codes  in effect at the time of its construction did not require the car platform to  have a car gate. As such  the car platform was enclosed on three sides with a  ceiling  and it was open to a hoistway on its fourth side. The accident  occurred when all three people were inside the car platform  ascending from  the first floor to the tenth with the second and final load of hangers.  According to the elevator operator  Employee #1's coworker  who was standing  at the rear of the car  reached out to tickle Employee #1 as they were  traveling between the third and fourth floors. This caused Employee #1  who  was standing at the front of the car  to take a step to the side in order to  turn around and face his coworker.

The space between the header of the floor landing and the car platform  was measured at 3.5 inches. Approximately three feet above the header and  located between each floor was a 60-degree bevel on the hoistway wall. The  bevel was required by code to provide clearance for the car platform to clear  each floor  because the sill of each the floor projected into the hoistway  more than the sill of the header. The employee's leg was pulled further  between the car platform and the hoistway when it was caught between the bevel  and the car platform. The clearance between the bevel and the car platform was  measured at 2.7 inches. The elevator operator used the phone in the car  platform to contact emergency medical services. Employee #1's leg was crushed.  Further  his femoral artery sustained so much damage that he bled out by the  time paramedics arrived. He died at the scene.                                  \"],\n",

Around 2:00 p.m. the three employees were taking asbestos  suspect samples at the fourth floor level of the boiler house. They entered a  small room (approximately 8-ft by 16-ft) in the northwest corner of the boiler  house. The west side of the room was barricaded by a 3-ft  6-inch yellow  railing which had been installed by USG in January 2006. The railing had no  gate and was clearly meant to block passage into that side of the room. The  roof over that portion of the room was deteriorated and partially collapsed   leaving a lot of roof debris on the floor area of the barricaded side of the  room. The area also contained a 3-ft  5-inch by 6-ft hole  which at one time  was for equipment or a chute (per USG management). USG had placed a piece of  styrofoam board over the hole to keep the rain from entering the boiler house  and barricaded the area to keep employees from entering that side of the room.  Per USG  that area was unoccupied space for their employees the majority of  the time. Over time  the roof debris covered the styrofoam board.

       "  '\" Employee #1 was working for a firm that compounded plastic resins. He was  using a \"\"Berger Belt \"\" a belt grinder made by the Heinz Berger company  which  was used to make pellets from nylon resin for carpet fibers and other  products. In the manufacturing process  resin was mixed with pigment  heated  for bonding purposes  and then passed through a trough where water was used as  a coolant. The product was then moved into an extruder for shaping purposes   cut into pellets  and carried up into a tote located over the drying belt. The  tote weighed approximately 409 kg  and it had a maximum capacity of 909 kg of  material per batch. The pellets were then dropped onto a belt and sent under  nine quartz lights used as heat lamps  with two bulbs each  for drying. This  phase of the process put a coating on the product to prevent the pellets from  sticking together. The belt was approximately 610 millimeters wide and 4.1  meters long. The manufacturing operation took approximately 2 to 8 hours.  Employee #1 was taking a sample off the belt to check the dryness of the  pellets. When he touched one of the light frames and a grounded piece of  equipment (a chiller) at the same time  he received an electric shock.  Employee #1 was taken to the hospital for observation and treated for  first-degree burns on his right hand. He returned to work the next day. A  maintenance technician checked the frame at the point of exposure and got a  reading of 279 volts (presumably AC). He deenergized the lights one bank at a  time and found that during assembly of the frame  a wire nut had become  pinched and had melted. The wire nut was stuck to the side frame. The \"\"Berger  Belt\"\" was connected to the facility\\'s wiring system through a cord and plug.  When the plug was checked  a loose connection was found at the feed end. The  Berger Belt machine had been assembled offsite and transported to the plant   where it had been in operation for 3 years without incident.                    \"'],\n",

The employee brought a Miller Arc welder with him to the boiler room. The  boiler room did not provide a suitable electric outlet for the welder  so the  employee obtained a 480-volt  three-phase pigtail extension cord adapter. The  adapter had three alligator clips at one end. The employee connected the  alligator clips to a 15-ampere circuit breaker in a motor panelboard and  connected the cord connector on the adapter to the attachment plug on the  welder's power supply cord. When he energized the welder  the circuit breaker  tripped. Following written instructions  the employee notified the chief  engineer  who determined that the welder's internal wiring was set at 240  volts. The chief engineer and the employee adjusted the wiring so that the  welder could run on 480 volts. The employee operated the welder with no  problems for the rest of the day  and he used the welder for approximately 1  hour over that period. At the end of the day  he turned off the welder and the  circuit breaker and stored the welder in the boiler room overnight. The next  day  the employee  who was accompanied by a coworker  returned to the boiler  room to finish his work. A fixed metal ladder to an overhead work area was  near the welder. The employee connected the welder and turned on the circuit  breaker. The two employees were discussing the proper way to proceed with the  work. The coworker was leaning on the welder  and the employee was on the  other end. The employee placed his right foot on the bottom rung on the ladder  and his right hand on the ladder and then touched the handle on the welder. He  received an electric shock and could not let go of the welder. He was finally  able to break himself from the ladder rung and fell to the concrete floor. He  was hospitalized with a fractured hip. The equipment grounding conductor on  the welder's attachment plug had been attached to an ungrounded circuit  conductor.                                                                      \"],\n",

The employee had worked  for the company for 2.5 years installing drywall. On the day of the accident   the employee was trying to locate an extension cord set to begin a job. He  found an extension cord set that was not being used. The cord was strung over  a block wall located outside on the school grounds.

They were going to drill to a depth of approximately 3700 meters and  were at a depth of 3123 meters. The employees would work 7 days on and 7 days  off. The evening and early morning temperatures at the well site were near 0  degrees Celsius. A derrick operator had been on the site for only 5 days   though the company had employed him previously. The employee asked his  supervisor if he could put the Dayton space heater at the site in the changing  room because it was extremely cold in the room during the evening and early  morning. The changing room was located in the front of a grounded metal  structure that had a tool room in the rear. A metal wall separated the two  rooms. A metal bench was located in the center of the changing room and metal  lockers were attached to the walls. The structure was located next to the site  power plant near the base of the drilling rig. The employer had the heater's  power supply cord coiled and resting on the platform between the tool room and  the power plant with a plastic bag over the attachment plug. To connect the  heater to a receptacle outlet  the employee ran the cord through an opening  near the ceiling of the changing room and through the tool room to the power  plant. The employee plugged the heater into a 240-volt outlet  turned it on   and found it to be working. The metal-framed heater was resting on the metal  bench in the center of the changing room  and the bench was welded to the  metal floor. When the employee lifted the heater off the bench to hang it on  the wall  he was electrocuted. An investigation found that the opening through  which the employee ran the cord was too small to accommodate the heavy-duty   240-volt  three-wire with ground  four-pin attachment plug on the heater's  power supply cord. It was believed that the employee had removed the plug   passed the cord through the hole  and reinstalled the plug. (The employer's  policy required any electrical work to be performed by an electrician.) The  equipment grounding conductor had been connected to the pin for a circuit  conductor  and the resulting ground fault had energized the frame of the  heater. The wiring inside the heater had deteriorated  but that had not  contributed to the accident.                                                    \"],\n",
